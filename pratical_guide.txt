This file contais a practical guide on how the content of the paper "An Initial UML Approach for EU AI Act Compliance" 
can be used with the generative AI system Gemini. The goal is to assist professionals in creating documentation 
templates aligned with the EU AI Act requirements without starting from scratch.

A new conversation should be initiated, and the entire content of Chapter 3 must be attached in DOC or PDF format - 
preferably as a single page to avoid interpretation issues. A simple prompt such as “read the attached files” 
should be sufficient for Gemini to interpret the content correctly.

After the file has been processed, an extended prompt must be provided. This prompt should include relevant information 
about the system to be documented. Below, an example prompt is shown: 

---Prompt Begin---

"You are an expert in AI compliance documentation.

Your task is to generate a compliance document aligned with Annex IV, Point 2 of the EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689), 
based on the UML approach provided in the attached file.

System Description:

System name: Breast Cancer Diagnostic AI (BCD-AI)
Module: ClinicalModule (tabular data: clinical and laboratory records)
Learning models: ModelA_MLP, ModelB_RF, ModelC_GB, ModelD_LR, ModelE_GB, ModelF_LR
Explainability methods (respectively): LIME, SHAP, ICE, Ceteris Profiles, ICE, Ceteris Profiles
Model accuracies (respectively): 95%, 97%, 99%, 97%, 95%, 97%
Model specialization:
- ModelA_MLP = women ≤ 35 years old
- ModelB_RF = women with family history
- ModelC_GB = irregular screening histories
- ModelD_LR = women > 60 years old
- ModelE_GB = women with poor lifestyle
- ModelF_LR = all other cases
Overall system accuracy: 97%
Dataset: Wisconsin Breast Cancer (scikit-learn 1.3)

Instructions:

1. Consult the official text of the EU AI Act (Annex IV) at:
   https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R1689.
   Do not access or use any other external sources.

2. Generate a formal, detailed, and compliance-oriented text that covers all subsections of Annex IV, Point 2, including:
   - Development process and design choices
   - Algorithms, models, and parameters
   - Architecture and module integration
   - Data provenance, cleaning, and labeling
   - Human oversight and explainability (integration of each explainability method)
   - Version control and model evolution
   - Validation and testing metrics
   - Traceability and documentation measures

3. The document must explicitly reference the UML class diagram of the ClinicalModule package.
   Use expressions such as “As illustrated in Figure X” or “The UML diagram (Figure X) provides a visual representation…”
   when describing system components.

4. Do not create UML figures or tables.
   Assume that the UML diagram will be inserted manually by the user in the appropriate section.

5. When referring to modeling elements, use their UML stereotype names naturally within the text (e.g., <<DataSource>>, 
<<TrainedModel>>, <<LimeExplainer>>, <<ShapExplainer>>, <<IceExplainer>>, <<CeterisExplainer>>).  
   Do not enumerate or tabulate them.

6. The generated text must narratively describe the contents and relationships shown in the UML diagram rather than 
listing components.

7. The tone must emulate a formal technical compliance report suitable for regulatory submission, using precise, auditable,
 and traceable language."
 
---Prompt End--- 


Gemini will then generate a documentation template for the system. The UML diagram must be inserted manually by the user. 
Depending on the system’s complexity and documentation size, response time may vary. In such cases, it is recommended to 
generate the documentation in parts (e.g., Point 2(a), Point 3, etc). 

The prompt may be personalized as needed. Human review remains essential to ensure consistency and compliance accuracy. 

The output generated can be found in the document "template_example.docx" in this repository.
